# Text Based Harry Potter RPG Game

I made this small game to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript interacting with HTML/CSS in the browser.

It's based on the first project of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript course (the 2024 BETA version). 

Things I've changed:
- Refactored the code (for example writing one function I can call for duplicated of code)
- Changed the story (it's now about Harry Potter instead of a generic fantasy story)
- Added a potion functionality, buy them in the store, use them during duels (instead of just buying health)
- Added extra UI features (extra info at the bottom of the game screen)
- Changed the look of the whole game (massive CSS changes).
