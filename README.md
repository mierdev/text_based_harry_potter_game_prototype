# Text Based Harry Potter Game - PROTOTYPE

I made this game to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript interacting with HTML/CSS in the browser.

It's based on the first project of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript course (the 2024 BETA version). I've refactored the code, added a potion functionality (instead of buying health), added extra UI features (extra info at the bottom of the game screen), and changed the look of the whole game.
